== 3. Sanity Check

=== Considerations
- Infrastructure/setup tasks included? [x] Yes [ ] No
- Technical spikes included? [x] Yes [ ] No
- Holidays accounted for? [x] Yes [ ] No
- Midterms/exams accounted for? [x] Yes [ ] No

We believe that this release plan is reasonable and well within our team's capacity. We specifically chose to
put the bulk of our work in sprints 1 and 2 so that we have plenty of time later in the development cycle to address any unforeseen issues or challenges.
Sprint 2 will occur during many of our midterms, and the effort required reflects this added burden. The same goes for Sprint 4 for finals week. We would be
able to divide the work evenly across the team for each user story.
